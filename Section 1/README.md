# Intro To HTML
## Section 1: HTML Structure Presentation

Contains all exercises carried out in section 1 of the course, mainly focussed around the basics of HTML. **Chapter 2** taught me how to *structure* a html file properly, focussing purely on the skeleton, and not so much the content. **Chapter 3** focussed more on the body, creating *tables* and how to add to it, along with making *lists*, ordered and unordered. **Chapter 4** was about *inputting* data into a webpage, whether it be through textboxes, or dropdown menus, hence creating a *form*.
